# Environment variables for the 10k_tiktok server
# Copy this file to `.env` for local development, or add these variables
# to your hosting provider (e.g., DigitalOcean App Platform) Runtime env.

# Run Puppeteer in headless mode (mandatory on servers without a display)
HEADLESS=1

# Notes:
# - The code already reads process.env.HEADLESS and will switch Puppeteer headless on.
# - On DigitalOcean App Platform: Settings -> Environment Variables -> add HEADLESS=1 and redeploy.
# - In Docker: pass `-e HEADLESS=1`.
# - Locally, you can set HEADLESS=0 to see the browser (only if you have a display):
#   HEADLESS=0
